# Rust principle #01

"By default variable are immutable"

```rust
let foo = 5; // foo is immutable
let mut bar = 5; // bar is mutable
```

[Code example](./principle01/src/main.rs)

# Rust principle #02

"Constant are never mutable"

```rust
const foo = 5; // foo is a constant (always immutable)
```
